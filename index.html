                    <h3>Welcome to Idle Mine: Remix!</h3>
                    <p>So you have decided to start with mining. You have heard that many treasures lie down below the surface, so you
                    can't wait to find out what you can find. Maybe you can become rich?<br/>
                    There's you, and your Auto-Mining-Device. Let's get started!</p>
                    <p>This also acts as s sort of guide. If something is unclear, look into here as a reference.</p>
                </div>
                <div v-if="storyDisplayed('firstMud')">
                    <p>You mined your first piece of <b>Mud</b>! Well, it's not worth a lot, but you've got to start somewhere.</p>
                    <div class="story-quote"><mine-object :level="0" :nodamage="true"></mine-object><span>Just some ordinary Mud</span></div>
                    <p>Even 2 $ can be a good start. Maybe you should try to mine something more precious?</p>
                </div>
                <div v-if="storyDisplayed('firstPaper')">
                    <p>You take your Pickaxe and proceed to hit some old homework with it (You didn't need it anymore, anyways).</p>
                    <div class="story-quote"><mine-object :level="1" :nodamage="true"></mine-object><span>Paper (Your old Homework)</span></div>
                    <p>For some reason it was worth a whopping 10 $! It seems like you've got the hang of it. Unfortunately, you also find out
                    that it was kind of resistent to your pickaxe, so you need to craft a better one to keep growing. Luckily you have this rusty
                    Blacksmith at home (for whatever reason). It doesnt look good enough though. You should try to Upgrade it.</p>
                    <h4>How do I get Gems?</h4>
                    <p>Every time you mine something, there is a chance that you will be awarded a Gem, used to craft Pickaxes.</p>
                    <h4>Stats, Stats, Stats...</h4>
                    <p>Some general Tips: Every Mineral has defense, which is an absolute reduction to click and idle damage.
                    To find out what's the most efficient to mine, look at where Money/s and Money per Click are the highest.
                    More gems/s mean that you can get gems faster to craft new Pickaxes. The base Damage of a pickaxe is calculated
                    by multiplying its power with the quality (for example: 1,000 * 150% = 1,500). After that, Active and Idle Power
                    Upgrades are applied.</p>
                </div>
                <div v-if="storyDisplayed('blacksmithUpgrade')">
                    <p>Just a little improvement to your Blacksmith makes it seem much stronger!</p>
                    <div class="story-quote"><img src="Images/upgrades/blacksmith.png"/><span>Blacksmith Power!</span></div>
                    <p>You should try to craft a new Pickaxe. You only need one Gem to do it! Luckily you have a few of them at home. You don't
                    remember when you got them, they are just here for some reason. After crafting, you should try your luck with salt.</p>
                    <h3>When should I craft?</h3>
                    <p>The power and quality of a pickaxe is based on Blacksmith Upgrades. The resulting power and quality will be random,
                        but will at least be as much as the minimum power and quality.</p>
                </div>
                <div v-if="storyDisplayed('firstSalt')">
                    <p>You take out all the salt from your kitchen drawer, and start to hammer on it with your newly crafted Pickaxe. It works
                    surpisingly well, you think.</p>
                    <div class="story-quote"><mine-object :level="2" :nodamage="true"></mine-object><span>Salt (from your Kitchen Drawer)</span></div>
                    <p>22 $! That is sure a lot. You could buy some Games from it, or you take it serious and invest the money into your blacksmith.</p>
                </div>
                <div v-if="storyDisplayed('firstClay')">
                    <p>You go to a nearby lake and dig out some clay.</p>
                    <div class="story-quote"><mine-object :level="3" :nodamage="true"></mine-object><span>Clay (fresh from the Lake)</span></div>
                    <p>It's already worth 50 $! That's much more than salt. Of course it was tougher, but the reward speaks for itself.
                    There's a Cave nearby. This is where the real adventure will start. Maybe you should improve your blacksmith a bit more and get a

                    Ever seen a saturn-like planet with a diameter of millions of kilometers? Well, it's impossible in our universe, but here it isn't...
                    If you replaced Saturn with this, you would probably clearly see the glowing rings in a clear night with your naked eye.

                    This planet, similar to earth, has a diameter of about 120,000,000 kilometers. That means that, if replaced with the sun, would stretch out to around mercuries
                    orbit.
                    <div class="story-quote"><mine-object :level="134" :nodamage="true"></mine-object><span>Much space for humans</span></div>
                    Superearth would be big enough to house trillions of people. Game Servers can't be worldwide because of extreme lag :( (no information can travel faster than the speed
                    of light). Also, imagine a YouTuber with over 100 billion subscribers :D

                        <b>Colossia:</b> If you replaced Saturn with this planet, it would appear much larger than our moon on the sky. It would break our solar system
                        due to its extreme gravitational force.

                    Phew, that was a big one. A million times bigger than Jupiter. Theoretically, a planet this big would have collapsed into a extremely massive black hole.

                    ... in this Universe. And it seems to get boring. Those Planets are just getting bigger and bigger, with arbitrary names. Why aren't we just mining Stars? Are they too hot? Possibly.
                    Get stronger and stronger, and soon Stars should be no Problem anymore.

                    Wait, what is this!? While chilling and moving through the vacuum, you see a rock flying by, a few meters in size. <i>What were the chances?</i>

                    <p>You found out how to mine Stars, let's go!</p>
                    <h4>How to get Wisdom?</h4>

                    Betelgeuse is around 500x as large as our Sun, and it is over 600 light years away. Early this year, it has gained attention because it quickly lost luminosity,
                    which possibly meant that Betelgeuse would go Supernova, creating a Nebula as bright as the full Moon, lasting for several Months.

                    <p>Thanks for playing my Game! This marks the end of the story. Your task now is to further explore the Multiverse,
                    filled with an infinite amount of new Universes to mine.</p>
                    <p>I wonder how far the numbers can go! Through the Gem Upgrades, progress should always be possible, and a progress wall
                    should be very far away. Can you reach {{numberFormatter.format(story.longGoal1)}} $?<br/>
                    Nah, your wisdom should make it even faster... can you reach {{numberFormatter.format(story.longGoal2)}} $? That's ∞<sup>4</sup>!</p>
                    <p>This doesn't mean it's the end forever. I could add new Content in the future to extend the story. Anyways, I hope you had
                    fun playing :)</p>
